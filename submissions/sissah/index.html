            <p>Author's birthplace. While I was only here for primary school, I frequently visit the city to see family. My grandmother lived right off the Loop so I was in the area quite a bit, so I like to think I know Delmar pretty well.
              My favorite part of the city though would have to be Forest Park. Its one of my favorite bike trails to ride through with the downtown area only five minutes away, followed by the St. Louis Zoo and art museum. I was always over in this area for school field trips or just playing with my siblings.
              A lot of good memories here, so I'm glad to able to come back from time to time.</p>

            <p>When I started grade school, my family decided to move to Illinois. I forgot the reason why we did this, probably a work opportunity or something. We still had plenty of family out in this area, but the change was more than just location. The neighborhood was filled with retirees and older families, so there wasn't a whole lot to do near home.
            Because I started to focus more on my studies rather than sports. During this time I began looking into computer programming through my dad, albeit only in bits and pieces. This was also the first time I attended a public school, which was a huge difference from the religious school I had been attending since pre-school. Overall a lot of big changes, but over the course of those eight years I came to love the city of Chicago for its culture and gritty charm.</p>

            <p>My dad moved out to find work again, and I decided to move out with him after my grade school graduation. I think by this point I found out that I found enjoyment in moving from place to place, so this time transitioning was not that big of a deal. Our time here was very short (We were just preparing to move to the next location on this list), I loved the area near the high rise apartment we were residing in. There was a huge forest trail behind the building that I (along with my father) rode down daily.
            The apartment itself was pretty neat too. Being the tallest building in the immediate vicinity, the view from the balcony was always amazing at night, looking over the forest trail and the zooming headlights from the highway below. When I wasn't doing that the pool and garden area were good places to read and work outside.</p>

            <p>For the record, this is not the British Columbia Vancouver. If you go all the way to the bottom of Washington (the state, not D.C), there's a modest sized town right off the I-5 from our next (and cooler) location on the list. I started high school out here, and I can honestly so with full confidence that I love the West Coast. Living in a state that contains a temperal rain forest is amazing. There's the bike trail that takes you across our mile long highway, beaches along the Columbia River, and constant 60-70 weather throughout three of the four seasons.
            Part of the reason I didn't go out much in grade school was because of my pollen allergies, which in Chicago suburbs is a death sentence. Being able to breathe in the summer allowed me to fully enjoy and appreciate the outdoors, especially camping.</p>
